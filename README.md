# Kalories

User can see a list of his meals and calories.
Calories are entered manually and each entry could be edited and deleted.

An entry has the following fields:
* date
* time
* text
* number of calories

User can filter date (from-to).
For example: how much calories have I had in the last week?
User can set the expected number of calories per day in a settings' panel.
When displayed, the total for that day is colored in green, otherwise it is red.
